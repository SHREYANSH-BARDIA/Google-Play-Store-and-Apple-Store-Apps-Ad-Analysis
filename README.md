This project is an analysis of the usage of apps that are available on Google play store for android devices and App store for iOS devices.  
Different categories of apps have been analysed on the basis of number of apps available for each category in both the stores, the average number of installations  
and the average rating given to each category in both the stores.  
The scope of this project is limited to applications that are free and have only English names.
